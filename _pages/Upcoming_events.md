Title: "Fermionic semiclassical Lp estimates"

Abstract: "Spectral properties of Schrödinger operators are studied a lot in mathematical physics. They can give the description of trapped fermionic particles. Researches on the spatial concentration of semiclassical Schrödinger operators' eigenfunctions are still carried out, whether in physics or in mathematics. This presentation will focus on the non-interacting case. I will explain why it is relevant to estimate L^p bounds of orthonormal families of eigenfuntions and then  give the main ideas of the proof."
