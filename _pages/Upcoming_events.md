Title : Mathematical modeling and simulation of waves in conducting poroelastic media using HDG method.

Abstract : " Near-surface exploration using wave propagation poses significant challenges and has been investigated for many years. Classically, for computational reasons, wave propagating in the subsurface are modeled as solutions to the elastic or acoustic equations. However, to improve the accuracy of the simulation, it is now necessary to consider more complex models such as conducting poroelasticmedia. The poroelasticmaterials are composed of an elastic solid frame and pores filled with fluid.  And the wave propagation is described by Biot’s model. In geophysical materials, when the fluid inside the pores is polarized, we can observe conversions between electromagnetic and seismic fields, which are called electrokinetic effects and are modeled using Pride’s equations, a coupling between Maxwell’s and Biot’s equations. The electrokinetic coupling has been observed in natural geophysical media both in laboratory experiments and on the field. The converted waves are very interesting because they are heavily sensitive to the medium properties, and the seismoelectric conversions could for example help to locate interfaces in the material that seismic waves cannot detect. The characterization of poroelastic or conducting poroelastic media is complex and involves many physical parameters, some of which depend non-linearly on the frequencies. In addition, the seismic and electromagnetic speeds are significantly different, which is complicated to handle for time domain simulations. Hence, we have chosen to solve the equations in the frequency domain and to use a Fourier transform to generate the seismograms in time domain. The main drawback to this is that we must invert one global linear system for each frequency, and this has a large computational cost because of the complexity of the equations and hence the high number of unknowns. We present the development and implementation of a Hybridizable Discontinuous Galerkin (HDG) method for solving Pride’s equations. We validate the code in two dimensions in circular geometry thanks to analytical solutions that we have developed. Using these analytical solutions, we show that the methods have an optimal order of convergence. In addition, to extend the method to infinite domains, we propose new radiation boundary condition for poroelastic equations and electrokinetic equations. We have also implemented Perfectly Matched Layers and we have compared the performances of the two methods. Finally, we show that the code we have developed is capable of modeling electrokinetic conversions in the time domain."
