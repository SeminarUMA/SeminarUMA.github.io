Title : "Inverse Problems Applied to Spatialized Audio"

Abstract : "The ability to identify the directions of incidence of the sounds we hear is the result of an empirical learning of acoustic phenomena since our earliest childhood. When we listen to a recording with headphones, the identification of sources is no longer possible because the sound arrives directly in our ears and does not undergo the same perturbations as during natural hearing. Immersion in a virtual sound scene requires processing the sound signal to reproduce the diffraction phenomena caused by our body. To do this, it is possible to measure (or calculate) its acoustic response and to build an audio filter, called HRTF (Head Related Transfer Function). Having a powerful solver for the direct problem, we are interested in two associated inverse problems: Given a bounded open domain and its HRTFs, what is the boundary condition? Given HRTFs and a boundary condition, what is the shape of the domain?"
